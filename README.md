# MSCS532_Phase2

You can run the application by running ```python3 main.py```
As this is just a partial implementation, I have only included few samples to test the overall data structures. More optimization and cleaner will be provided as part of Phase 3 & 4. 

You can add more tests or change the existing ones in the main.py file itself# MSCS532_Phase3
